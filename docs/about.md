This site is maintained by Claude Vervoort. Welcome! For a bit of context, I've been contributing to Moodle External Tool module since 2017 and a long time contributor to the IMS Global LTI working group.

I am currently employed by Cengage, and thankful for the support of my employer to my engagement on Moodle and the advancement of the LTI specifications.

I also sometimes post Youtube videos, check my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKcdpZMUQj5kU4TssE8Q1Jg), and even subscribe so that I can brag about my subscribers count to my kids!
